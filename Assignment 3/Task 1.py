# Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
# 1.   Defines a function named factorial that takes a number as an argument and calculates its factorial using a loop or recursion.
# 2.   Returns the calculated factorial.
# 3.   Calls the function with a sample number and prints the output.

def factorial(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

number = int(input("Enter a number to calculate its factorial: "))  
result = factorial(number)
print(f"The factorial of {number} is {result}")
