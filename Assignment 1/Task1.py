# Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations
# Problem Statement: Write a Python program that does the following:
# 1.  Takes two numbers as input from the user.
# 2.  Performs the basic mathematical operations on these two numbers:
#         o	Addition
#         o	Subtraction
#         o	Multiplication
#         o	Division
# 3.  Displays the results of each operation on the screen.

number1 = int(input("Enter the first number  : "))
number2 = int(input("Enter the second number  : "))

print(f"Addition : {number1 + number2}")
print(f"Subtraction : {number1 - number2}")
print(f"Multiplication : {number1 * number2}")
print(f"Division : {number1 / number2}")
